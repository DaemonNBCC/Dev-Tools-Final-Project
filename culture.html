                  The music of Greece is as diverse and celebrated as its history. Greek 
                  music separates into two parts: Greek traditional music and Byzantine 
                  music. These compositions have existed for millennia: they originated 
                  in the Byzantine period and Greek antiquity; there is a continuous 
                  development which appears in the language, the rhythm, the structure 
                  and the melody. Music is a significant aspect of Hellenic culture, 
                  both within Greece and in the diaspora. Greek musical history extends 
                  far back into ancient Greece, since music was a major part of ancient 
                  Greek theater. Later influences from the Roman Empire, Eastern Europe 
                  and the Byzantine Empire changed the form and style of Greek music. In 
                  the 19th century, opera composers, like Nikolaos Mantzaros (1795–1872), 
                  Spyridon Xyndas (1812–1896) and Spyridon Samaras (1861–1917) and 
                  symphonists, like Dimitris Lialios and Dionysios Rodotheatos revitalized 
                  Greek art music.

                  The first great ancient Greek civilization were the Minoans, a Bronze Age 
                  Aegean civilization on Crete and other Aegean Islands, that flourished from 
                  c. 3000 BC to c. 1450 BC and, after a late period of decline, finally ended 
                  around 1100 BC during the early Greek Dark Ages. At the height of their power, 
                  they built architecture ranging from city houses and Minoan palaces. Exemplary 
                  of this construction was the palace at Knossos, which was composed of two to 
                  three levels, had over 500 rooms and many terraces with porticos and stairs. 
                  The interior of this palace included monumental reception halls, vast apartments 
                  for the queen and bridesmaids, baths with complete sewage and drainage systems, 
                  food deposits, shops, theatres, sport arenas, and other amenities. The walls were 
                  built of high quality masonry that was covered with highly-decorated frescos.

                  Greek dance (choros; Greek: χορός, romanized: chorós) is a very old tradition, being referred 
                  to by authors such as Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian. There are different styles and 
                  interpretations from all of the islands and surrounding mainland areas. Each region formed its 
                  own choreography and style to fit in with their own ways. For example, island dances have more 
                  of a different smooth flow to them, while Pontic dancing closer to the Black Sea, is very sharp. 
                  There are over 10,000 traditional dances that come from all regions of Greece. There are also 
                  pan-Hellenic dances, which have been adopted throughout the Greek world. These include specifically 
                  the Syrtos, Kalamatianos, Pyrrhichios, Ballos, Zeibekiko, and hasapiko.Traditional Greek dancing has 
                  a primarily social function. It brings the community together at key points of the year, such as Easter, 
                  the grape harvest or patronal festivals; and at key points in the lives of individuals and families, such 
                  as weddings. For this reason, tradition frequently dictates a strict order in the arrangement of the 
                  dancers, for example, by age. Greek dances are performed also in diaspora Greek communities among 
                  international folk dance groups.

                  Greek cuisine (Greek: Ελληνική Κουζίνα) is the cuisine of Greece and the Greek diaspora. 
                  In common with many other cuisines of the Mediterranean, it is founded on the triad of wheat, 
                  olive oil, and wine. It uses vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, and meat, including pork, 
                  poultry, veal and beef, lamb, rabbit, and goat. Other important ingredients include pasta (for 
                  example hilopites), cheeses, lemon juice, herbs, olives, and yogurt. Bread made of wheat is 
                  ubiquitous; other grains, notably barley, are also used, especially for paximathia. Common dessert 
                  ingredients include nuts, honey, fruits, sesame, and filo pastries. It continues traditions from 
                  Ancient Greek and Byzantine cuisine, while incorporating Ottoman, Balkan, and Italian influences.

                  Ancient Greek crafts (or the craftsmanship in Ancient Greece) was an important but largely undervalued, 
                  economic activity. It involved all activities of manufacturing transformation of raw materials, agricultural 
                  or not, both in the framework of the oikos and in workshops of important size that gathered several tens of 
                  workers.The artisans or "craftsmen" constituted a minority population in the Greek city of Polis, but whose 
                  presence in the sources is not disproved since it was seen to grow throughout Greek Antiquity.In Ancient Greece, 
                  there were craftsmen of different social strata. If the metics and slaves were probably in the majority, there 
                  were also many free citizens in the workshops. They developed crafts such as musical instruments, sculptures, 
                  pottery, etc.Much of Ancient Greek craftsmanship was part of the domestic sphere. However, the situation 
                  gradually changed between the 8th and 4th centuries BC, with the increasing commercialization of the Greek 
                  economy. Thus, important tasks as weaving or baking bread were performed only by women before the 6th century 
                  BC. With the growth of trade, slave labor began to be used extensively in handicrafts. Only the best quality 
                  dyed cloth, and in particular Tyrian purple, was made in the workshops.
