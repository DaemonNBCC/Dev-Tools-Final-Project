                            The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages and as a result, the
                            history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes. Generally, the history of Greece
                            is divided into the following periods:

                            Paleolithic Greece, starting c. 3.3 million years ago and ending in 20000 BC. Significant
                            geomorphological and climatic changes occurred in the modern Greek area which were
                            definitive for the development of fauna and flora and the survival of Homo sapiens in the
                            region.
                            Mesolithic Greece, starting in 13000 BC and ending around 7000 BC, was a period of long and
                            slow development of primitive human "proto-communities".
                            Neolithic Greece, beginning with the establishment of agricultural societies around 7000 BC
                            and ending c. 3200 – c. 3100 BC, was a vital part of the early history of Greece because it
                            was the base for early Bronze Age civilizations in the area. The first organized communities
                            developed and basic art became more advanced in Neolithic Greece.
                            Bronze Age Greece (c. 3200 – c. 1100 BC) began with the transition to a metal-based economy
                            during the Early Helladic period of mainland Greece (c. 3200 – c. 2000 BC). Meanwhile,
                            Cycladic culture prospered in the Cyclades (c. 3200 – c. 1050 BC) and Minoan civilization
                            around Crete (c. 3500 – c. 1100 BC). The Bronze Age ended with the rise and fall of the
                            Mycenaean Greek palace culture (c. 1750 – c. 1050 BC) in the Late Bronze Age collapse.
                            Ancient Greece usually encompasses Greek antiquity, as well as part of the region's late
                            prehistory (Late Bronze Age). It lasted from c. 1200 BC – c. 600 AD and can be subdivided
                            into the following periods:
                            Greek Dark Ages (or Iron Age, Homeric Age), 1100–800 BC
                            Archaic period, 800–490 BC
                            Classical period, 490–323 BC
                            Hellenistic period, 323–146 BC
                            Roman Greece, covering the period of the Roman conquest of Greece from 146 BC – 324 AD
                            Byzantine Greece covers the period of Greece under the Byzantine Empire, lasting from the
                            establishment of Constantinople as the capital city of Byzantium in 324 AD until the fall of
                            Constantinople in 1453.
                            Frankish/Latin Greece (including the Venetian possessions) lasted from the Fourth Crusade in
                            1204 AD to 1797, the year of the disestablishment of the Venetian Republic.
                            Ottoman Greece covers the period of Ottoman occupation of Greece from 1453 until the Greek
                            Revolution of 1821.
                            Modern Greece covers the period from 1821 to present.
                            At its cultural and geographical peak, Greek civilization spread from Egypt all the way to
                            the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan. Since then, Greek minorities have continued to
                            inhabit former Greek territories (e.g. Turkey, Albania, Italy, Libya, Levant, Armenia,
                            Georgia), and Greek emigrants have assimilated into differing societies across the globe
                            (e.g., North America, Australia, Northern Europe, South Africa). At present, most Greeks
                            live in the modern states of Greece (independent since 1821) and Cyprus.

                            Aristotle (/ˈærɪˌstɒtəl/;[1] Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pronounced [aristotélɛːs];
                            384–322 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range
                            of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics,
                            psychology and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the
                            Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the
                            groundwork for the development of modern science.

                            Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern
                            Greece during the Classical period. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child,
                            and he was brought up by a guardian. At 17 or 18 he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and
                            remained there till the age of 37 (c. 347 BC). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left
                            Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored his son Alexander the Great
                            beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many
                            of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls.

                            Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a
                            third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle
                            provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. His
                            teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant global impact, and as a result, his
                            philosophy has exerted an influence across the world and it continues to be a subject of
                            contemporary philosophical discussion.

                            Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of his physical
                            science extended from late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and was
                            not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics
                            were developed. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on
                            the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century.
                            He influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian
                            theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of
                            the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First
                            Teacher", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply "The Philosopher",
                            while the poet Dante called him "the master of those who know". His works contain the
                            earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter
                            Abelard and Jean Buridan. Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th
                            century. In addition, his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with
                            the modern advent of virtue ethics.

                            The Olympic games were first held in 776 BC with occasions occurring almost twenty years
                            before Rome was even colonized. The Olympics were initially a strict occasion the Greeks
                            facilitated at regular intervals. The games occurred almost a 42-foot sculpture of the
                            fanciful god, Zeus. Members were just men and they partook naked. The early games included
                            basic challenges like foot races, wrestling and spear. Victors were given an olive wreath
                            and their names would be kept in the authority record book. They were not granted for wins
                            in cash however here and there is food and other fundamental things during the Ancient Greek
                            occasions.
