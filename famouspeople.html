                  Philosophy (love of wisdom in ancient Greek) is a systematic
                  study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics
                  like existence, reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language.
                  It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its own
                  methods and assumptions. Historically, many of the individual
                  sciences, such as physics and psychology, formed part of
                  philosophy. However, they are considered separate academic
                  disciplines in the modern sense of the term. Western
                  philosophy originated in Ancient Greece and covers a wide area
                  of philosophical subfields.

                Socrates (/ˈsɒkrətiːz/; Greek: Σωκράτης; c. 470–399 BC) was a
                Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of
                Western philosophy and among the first moral philosophers of the
                ethical tradition of thought. An enigmatic figure, Socrates
                authored no texts and is known mainly through the posthumous
                accounts of classical writers, particularly his students Plato
                and Xenophon. These accounts are written as dialogues, in which
                Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of
                question and answer; they gave rise to the Socratic dialogue
                literary genre. Contradictory accounts of Socrates make a
                reconstruction of his philosophy nearly impossible, a situation
                known as the Socratic problem. Socrates was a polarizing figure
                in Athenian society. In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and
                corrupting the youth. After a trial that lasted a day, he was
                sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing
                offers to help him escape.

                  Plato (/ˈpleɪtoʊ/ PLAY-toe; Greek: Πλάτων Plátōn; 428/427 or
                  424/423 – 348 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher born in
                  Athens during the Classical period. In Athens, Plato founded
                  the Academy, a philosophical school where he taught the
                  philosophical doctrines that would later become known as
                  Platonism. Plato, or Platon, was a pen name derived,
                  apparently, from the nickname given to him by his wrestling
                  coach – allegedly a reference to his physical girth. According
                  to Alexander Polyhistor, quoted by Diogenes Laërtius, his
                  actual name was Aristocles, son of Ariston, of the deme
                  (suburb) Collytus, in Athens. Plato was an innovator of the
                  written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. He raised
                  problems for what became all the major areas of both
                  theoretical philosophy and practical philosophy. His most
                  famous contribution is the theory of forms (or ideas), which
                  has been interpreted as advancing a solution to what is now
                  known as the problem of universals. He is the namesake of
                  Platonic love and the Platonic solids. His own most decisive
                  philosophical influences are usually thought to have been,
                  along with Socrates, the pre-Socratics Pythagoras, Heraclitus,
                  and Parmenides, although few of his predecessors' works remain
                  extant and much of what is known about these figures today
                  derives from Plato himself.

                  philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of
                  subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy,
                  linguistics, economics, politics, psychology and the arts. As
                  the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the
                  Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition
                  that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of
                  modern science.

                  Spiro Theodore Agnew (November 9, 1918 – September 17, 1996)
                  was the 39th vice president of the United States, serving from
                  1969 until his resignation in 1973. He is the second of two
                  vice presidents to resign the position, the first being John
                  C. Calhoun in 1832. Agnew was born in Baltimore to a Greek
                  immigrant father and an American mother. He attended Johns
                  Hopkins University and graduated from the University of
                  Baltimore School of Law. He worked as an aide to U.S.
                  Representative James Devereux before he was appointed to the
                  Baltimore County Board of Zoning Appeals in 1957. In 1962, he
                  was elected Baltimore county executive. In 1966, Agnew was
                  elected governor of Maryland, defeating his Democratic
                  opponent George P. Mahoney and independent candidate Hyman A.

                  Aiskhýlos; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek
                  tragedian often described as the father of tragedy. Academic
                  knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding
                  of earlier Greek tragedy is largely based on inferences made
                  from reading his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he
                  expanded the number of characters in the theatre and allowed
                  conflict among them. Formerly, characters interacted only with
                  the chorus.
