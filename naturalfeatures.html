                    Greece has the longest coastline in Europe and is the southernmost country in Europe. The mainland has rugged mountains, forests, and lakes, but the country is well known for the thousands of islands dotting the blue Aegean Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the west.

                  Greece is mostly a mountainous country and almost 25% of the
                  territory is covered with forests, making it the fourth
                  largest country in Europe with respect to forest resources.
                  The majority of the forests in Greece are natural and not
                  technical. The most usual trees to see in the forests in
                  Greece are firs, Aleppo pines, black pines and other
                  coniferous, while there are also large quantities of beeches,
                  chestnuts, oaks and plane trees. The climate of Greece is
                  typically the Mediterranean over most of the country. This
                  gives warm to hot summers and mild winters. There is little
                  rain in summer and rare snowfalls in winter in low altitude.
                  Snow falls on high mountain tops in the winter months,
                  particularly on the northern side of the country (Epirus and
                  Macedonia). It rarely snows on the Greek islands, except for
                  the island of Crete island which sees snowfalls on the top of
                  the White Mountains and Mount Psiloritis. Apart from rich
                  flora, the forests in Greece also host fauna of high
                  biodiversity. A large variety of mammals live there, such as
                  the brown bear, the wolf, the jackal, the badger, the fox, and
                  the deer. Numerous kinds of birds, reptiles, and insects are
                  live in Greek forests. This is why many of these forests have
                  been proclaimed as National Parks.

                  Rivers in Greece are relatively small in comparison to rivers
                  of other countries. They start from the mountaintops where the
                  snow melts, cross the valleys below and usually empty in the
                  sea, or in some cases in lakes. The rivers in Greece are
                  shallow and turbulent, which makes them great for rafting,
                  river trekking, and canoe-kayak. The longest flowing rivers in
                  Greece are Evros and Axios. However, they both originate from
                  neighboring countries and empty in the Greek sea. The longest
                  river that has its springs in the country is Aliakmon River,
                  which flows through western Macedonia. Apart from some
                  sections of Rivers Evros and Loudias, the rest are not
                  navigable due to the rush of the waters. Important ecosystems
                  and hydro biotopes have been formed along the lengths of many
                  rivers in Greece. These ecosystems are protected by
                  international agreements. In the summer months, cultural
                  events are organized at the riversides, such as the famous
                  3-day River Party in Nestorio Kastoria and the Summer Party in
                  the Springs of Acheron in Parga. In winter and spring, rafting
                  activities are organized in many Greek rivers. Very famous
                  rivers for rafting and canoeing-kayaking are Voidomatis River
                  in Zagorochoria, Lousios River in central Peloponnese and
                  Evinos River in Nafpaktos.

                  It is the Dunes of Bartholomew, a landscape where the sand covers everything and the 
                  vegetation is minimal. The locals usually call it "The desert of Greece".Its area is 
                  about 1,000 hectares.Thousands of years of accumulation of sand by the westerly winds 
                  that normally blow in this area have created this eerie landscape reminiscent of the 
                  Sahara.The few trees that exist are trying to survive in adverse conditions.The dunes 
                  (i.e. the sand mountains) dominate the area and make the spectacle of flying over them 
                  unique. This is a dry area of 70 hectares with no particular vegetation, covered by sand.
                  It is located in the Gomati area of Lemnos and is known as "the sand dunes in Gomati" 
                  due to the thick sandy beaches that exist in this area that are called sand dunes.

                  Greece is primarily a mountainous country. The most significant range of mountains 
                  in Greece is the Pindus, forming the main mountain-axis of the country, starting 
                  from Epirus and naturally extending till Peloponnese and Crete. This mountain axis 
                  gives the highest peaks in the country.Mount Olympus in Macedonia is the highest 
                  mountain in Greece, reaching a height of 2,917 m (Mytikas peak). Olympus is 
                  world-famous as the home of the Greek gods. This is why they were also called the 
                  Olympian Gods.About 40 mountain ranges in Greece exceed the elevation of 2,000 m, 
                  including:Mounts Smolikas (2637m), Kaimaktsalan (2524m), Gramos (2520m), Giona (2510m), 
                  Parnassus (2457m), Psiloritis (2456m), White Mountains (2452) and Taygetos (2404m).The 
                  mountains in Greece distinguish for their rich biodiversity, rare scenery and unique forests. 
                  Various species of flora and fauna exist in their forests, which is why many of them are 
                  protected as National Parks. These forests and the villages in the mountains create the 
                  perfect setting for autumn and winter holidays in Greece. As in winter, it is snowing on 
                  the slopes of the highest mountains of Greece, ski centers operate there and receive many 
                  visitors. Apart from skiing, many other sports can be practiced in the Greek mountains. 
                  In fact, there are many mountaineering and alpine clubs that offer organized activities 
                  in the mountainsides, from hiking and mountain biking to horse riding.
