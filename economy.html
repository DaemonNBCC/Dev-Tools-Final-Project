                  Tourism in Greece has been a key element of the economic activity in the country, 
                  and is one of the country's most important sectors. Greece has been a major tourist 
                  destination and attraction in Europe since the 1970s for its rich culture and history, 
                  which is reflected in large part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, among the most 
                  in Europe and the world as well as for its long coastline, many islands, and beaches. 
                  The Egremnoi sand beach in the Greek island of Lefkada, noted for its blue crystal waters, 
                  is a popular tourist destination. Greece attracted as many as 31.3 million visitors in 2019, 
                  up from 24 million in 2015, making Greece one of the most visited countries in Europe and the world, 
                  and contributing to approximately 25% to the nation's Gross Domestic Product.[8]Greece is one of 
                  Europe's most popular LGBT tourist destinations. The religious tourism and pilgrimages, the 
                  ecotourism, the conference tourism, and the medical tourism are prominent, and initiatives are 
                  being made to promote the seasonal tourism as well. Some of the country's major tourist 
                  destinations include the capital city Athens, the islands of Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes, 
                  Corfu and Crete, as well as the peninsula of Chalkidice.

                  <p>Greece is a maritime nation by tradition, as shipping is arguably the oldest form of occupation 
                    of the Greeks and has been a key element of Greek economic activity since ancient times. Today, 
                    shipping is the country's most important industry worth $21.9 billion in 2018. If related businesses 
                    are added, the figure jumps to $23.7 billion, employs about 392,000 people (14% of the workforce), 
                    and shipping receipts are about 1/3 of the nation's trade deficit. In 2018, the Greek Merchant 
                    Navy controlled the world's largest merchant fleet, in terms of tonnage, with a total DWT of 834,649,089 
                    tons and a fleet of 5,626 Greek-owned vessels, according to Lloyd's List. Greece is also ranked in 
                    the top for all kinds of ships, including first for tankers and bulk carriers. Many Greek shipping 
                    companies have their headquarters located either in Athens or London and New York City, and are run by 
                    Greek traditional shipping families which are notable for their great wealth and influence in the 
                    international maritime industry. The 7th Secretary General (2003-2011) of the International Maritime 
                    Organization was Efthymios Mitropoulos.</p>

                    <p>Mining of different minerals in Greece has a long history and dates back to about 1000 BCE. Despite 
                      the long history of minerals in the country, the industry has contributed very little to the economy 
                      of Greece. Some of the minerals found in Greece include zinc, lead lignite, magnesite, bauxite, and 
                      petroleum. As of 2015, the country was the 7th leading exporter of pumice in the world, and by far 
                      the worldâ€™s largest producer of perlite. Greece produces approximately 1% of the total bauxite in 
                      the world and about 9% of all the bentonite produced in the world. The mining industry in the country 
                      processes the produced mineral fuels, metals, industrial minerals. The mining industry in Greece is 
                      harmonized by the mining code, which stipulates several regulations and laws on the extraction of 
                      ornamental rocks and industrial minerals. The code also states the safety and health factors for 
                      various quarrying and mining activities.</p>

                  The first great ancient Greek civilization were the Minoans, a Bronze Age 
                  Aegean civilization on Crete and other Aegean Islands, that flourished from 
                  c. 3000 BC to c. 1450 BC and, after a late period of decline, finally ended 
                  around 1100 BC during the early Greek Dark Ages. At the height of their power, 
                  they built architecture ranging from city houses and Minoan palaces. Exemplary 
                  of this construction was the palace at Knossos, which was composed of two to 
                  three levels, had over 500 rooms and many terraces with porticos and stairs. 
                  The interior of this palace included monumental reception halls, vast apartments 
                  for the queen and bridesmaids, baths with complete sewage and drainage systems, 
                  food deposits, shops, theatres, sport arenas, and other amenities. The walls were 
                  built of high quality masonry that was covered with highly-decorated frescos.

                  Greece is classified as an advanced, high-income economy, and was a founding member of the 
                  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and of the Organization of the 
                  Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). The country joined what is now the European Union in 1981. 
                  In 2001 Greece adopted the euro as its currency, replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate 
                  of 340.75 drachmae per euro. Greece is a member of the International Monetary Fund and of the World 
                  Trade Organization, and ranked 34th on Ernst & Young's Globalization Index 2011.
