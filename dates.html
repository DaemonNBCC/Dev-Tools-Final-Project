                    saving time, which moves one hour ahead to UTC+03:00 is

                    Epiphany (/əˈpɪfəni/ ə-PIF-ə-nee), also known as "Theophany"
                    in Eastern Christian tradition, is a Christian feast day
                    commemorating the visit of the Magi, the baptism of Jesus,
                    and the wedding at Cana. In Western Christianity, the feast
                    commemorates principally (but not solely) the visit of the
                    Magi to the Christ Child, and thus Jesus Christ's physical
                    manifestation to the Gentiles. It is sometimes called Three
                    Kings' Day, and in some traditions celebrated as Little
                    Christmas. Moreover, the feast of the Epiphany, in some
                    denominations, also initiates the liturgical season of
                    Epiphanytide.

                    known as Pure Monday, Ash Monday, Monday of Lent or Green
                    Monday, is the first day of Great Lent throughout Eastern
                    Christianity and is a moveable feast, falling on the sixth
                    Monday before Palm Sunday which begins Holy Week, preceding
                    Pascha Sunday (Easter). The common term for this day, "Clean
                    Monday", refers to the leaving behind of sinful attitudes
                    and non-fasting foods. It is sometimes called "Ash Monday",
                    by analogy with Ash Wednesday (the first day of Lent in
                    Western Christianity). The term is often a misnomer, as only
                    a small subset of Eastern Catholic Churches practice the
                    imposition of ashes. The Maronite, Chaldean and the
                    Syro-Malabar Catholic Churches are notable amongst the
                    Eastern rites employing the use of ashes on this day.

                    The celebration of the Greek Revolution of 1821 (Greek:
                    Εορτασμός της Ελληνικής Επανάστασης του 1821, Eortasmós tis
                    Ellinikís Epanástasis tou 1821), less commonly known as
                    Independence Day, takes place in Greece, Cyprus and Greek
                    diaspora centers on 25 March every year, coinciding with the
                    Feast of the Annunciation. The day is a public holiday in
                    Greece and Cyprus. Usually celebrations include parades and
                    other celebratory events on the same day or its eve. The
                    largest event is the military parade in Athens on 25 March,
                    while on the previous day, celebrations take place
                    throughout the schools of the country. In other
                    municipalities parades of military divisions, students,
                    clubs, etc. are held, as well as church services. More
                    broadly, the holiday acknowledges the successful Greek War
                    of Independence (1821–1829) was fought to liberate and
                    decolonize Greece from four centuries of Ottoman occupation.
                    After nine years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an
                    independent state under the London Protocol of February
                    1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the London
                    Conference of 1832 and the Treaty of Constantinople (1832);
                    these defined the final borders of the new state and
                    recognized the king. The holiday was established in 1838
                    with a Royal Decree by King Otto's government.

                    Whit Monday or Pentecost Monday, also known as Monday of the
                    Holy Spirit, is the holiday celebrated the day after
                    Pentecost, a moveable feast in the Christian liturgical
                    calendar. It is moveable because it is determined by the
                    date of Easter. In the Catholic Church, it is the Memorial
                    of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church, marking
                    the resumption of Ordinary Time. Whit Monday gets its
                    English name from "Whitsunday", an English name for
                    Pentecost, one of the three baptismal seasons. The origin of
                    the name "Whit Sunday" is generally attributed to the white
                    garments formerly worn by those newly baptized on this
                    feast.

                    The Dormition of the Mother of God is a Great Feast of the
                    Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic
                    Churches (except the East Syriac churches). It celebrates
                    the "falling asleep" (death) of Mary the Theotokos ("Mother
                    of God", literally translated as God-bearer), and her being
                    taken up into heaven. It is celebrated on 15 August (28
                    August N.S. in the Julian Calendar) as the Feast of the
                    Dormition of the Mother of God. The Armenian Apostolic
                    Church celebrates the Dormition not on a fixed date, but on
                    the Sunday nearest 15 August. In Western Churches the
                    corresponding feast is known as the Assumption of Mary, with
                    the exception of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which has
                    traditionally celebrated the Falling Asleep of the Blessed
                    Virgin Mary on 15 August. Christian canonical scriptures do
                    not record the death or Dormition of Mary. Hippolytus of
                    Thebes, a 7th- or 8th-century author, writes in his
                    partially preserved chronology of the New Testament that
                    Mary lived for 11 years after the death of Jesus, dying in
                    AD 41. The use of the term dormition expresses the belief
                    that the Virgin died without suffering, in a state of
                    spiritual peace. This belief does not rest on any scriptural
                    basis, but is affirmed by Orthodox sacred tradition. Some
                    apocryphal writings testify to this opinion, though neither
                    the Orthodox Church nor other Christians accord them
                    scriptural authority. The Orthodox understanding of the
                    Dormition is compatible with Roman Catholic teaching, and
                    was the dominant belief within the Western Church until late
                    in the Middle Ages, when the slightly different belief in
                    the bodily Assumption of Mary into heaven began to gain
                    ground. Pope Pius XII declared the latter a dogma of the
                    Catholic Church in 1950.

                    Greco-Italian War and Greek resistance during the Axis
